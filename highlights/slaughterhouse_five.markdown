> I have also told them not to work for companies which make massacre machinery, and to express contempt for people who think we need machinery like that.


> I wake to sleep, and take my waking slow. I feel my fate in what I cannot fear. I learn by going where I have to go.


> “The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist.


> Like so many Americans, she was trying to construct a life that made sense from things she found in gift shops.


> GOD GRANT ME THE SERENITY TO ACCEPT THE THINGS I CANNOT CHANGE, COURAGE TO CHANGE THE THINGS I CAN, AND WISDOM ALWAYS TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.


> Billy was guided by dread and the lack of dread. Dread told him when to stop. Lack of it told him when to move again. He stopped.


> “Well, here we are, Mr. Pilgrim, trapped in the amber of this moment. There is no why.”


> There isn’t any particular relationship between all the messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. There is no beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time.”


> Rosewater said an interesting thing to Billy one time about a book that wasn’t science fiction. He said that everything there was to know about life was in The Brothers Karamazov, by Feodor Dostoevsky. “But that isn’t enough any more,” said Rosewater.


> She made him feel embarrassed and ungrateful and weak because she had gone to so much trouble to give him life, and to keep that life going, and Billy didn’t really like life at all.


> And on and on it went—that duet between the dumb, praying lady and the big, hollow man who was so full of loving echoes.
