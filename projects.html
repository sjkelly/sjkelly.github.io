    <a href="http://github.com/textcad/"><h1>textcad</h1></a>
    textcad was started after many hours of developing deeply-parametric designs in OpenSCAD. It is in active development.

    HaytchBot is a deeply-parametric H-Bot platform. It was designed in textcad.

    <a href="https://github.com/sjkelly/Magpie"><h1>Magpie</h1></a>
    Magpie is a comprehensive hardware library for OpenSCAD. Development has stopped to focus on more versitile CAD platforms, however the project remains highly useful.

    <a href="https://github.com/sjkelly/RepRap-Lewis"><h1>RepRap Lewis</h1></a>
    A deeply-parametric 3D printer prototype. It uses a SCARA system for X-Y motion and a sarrus linkage for Z motion, leading it to be one of the lowest hardware count 3D printers that has never been documented.

    <a href="https://github.com/sjkelly/EagleToOpenSCAD"><h1>Eagle to OpenSCAD</h1></a>
    This is an Eagle plug-in to generate OpenSCAD files.

    This was one of my first explorations with parametric design. It never printed more than a few tests. It was my first real foray into Git and hardware design.
