> We have to build a common future in which we consume so little that the world can support us and not die. We must share and cooperate so effectively that human beings are freed from their impulse to hurt eachother for more than their fair share. And now you are responsible for identifying where the violence is in your life right through the supply chains, right through the energy grid, and right through your governments to figure out what it means to live as a responsible human being who takes no more than your fair share and oppresses no one by your very existence.

> People would ask, 'are they art or are they toys?', and I'd say, 'Both, and selling them is part of the artwork too.'
