    I am a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts. I grew up in Hicksville, New York. My passions are open source hardware and software. Particularly I am involved with distributed manufacturing and CAD software development. My goal in life is to live in a culture of open development.
