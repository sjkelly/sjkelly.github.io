title:  "Mediastan and some thoughts on the fifth estate"
---

_Mediastan_ is a documentary by [Johannes Wahlstr√∂m](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Wahlstr%C3%B6m), documenting the interactions he had with various central Asian reporting agencies as he worked with [WikiLeaks](https://wikileaks.org/) to publish the diplomatic cables leaked by [Chelsea Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning). At one part in the documentary Johannes describes how he was removed from his job in Sweden by publishing interviews about the "conditions journalists work in Israel and Palestine". He was effectively doing journalism about journalists doing journalism. Mediastan follows a similar idea, which makes it deeply revealing and, in my opinion, interesting.

As this is the first documentary by Wikileaks I have seen, I am interested in how this is documentary could be biased. It should be noted that other documentaries about Wikileaks, notably We Steal Secrets has come under scrutiny by the organization, particularly through an [annotated transcript](http://wikileaks.org/IMG/html/gibney-transcript.html) of the film. That said, this film is very unbiased. It neither shows opposing journalists in a negative light, nor is critical. This is key for the validity and acceptance of the presentation, and something I imagine Johannes has learned from his [previous works](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Wahlstr%C3%B6m#Ordfrontdebatten).

Particularly this film shows how WikiLeaks goes about distributing information through "gentleman's agreements", which encourage unbiased review, through analysis, and redaction of harmful information. One particular part I found interesting were two editors comments in Kazakhstan (about 23 minutes into the film). The first one had interesting comments regarding politics, in particular his views of [self determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination). This is seems to be a common feeling among many of the journalists interviewed, however his feeling is highlighted when he says "I don't believe in this one man, one vote stuff". I am not sure if this should be interpreted as revealing bias or not. The possible bias would be the perception of journalists as [statists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statism) and [non-statists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism). It is evident that if a journalist accepts the leaks they might has a different view of how government should behave than one who decides to obey censor or does not perceive benefit from them.

The other editor addresses the issue in a manner I find interesting, calling Wikileaks an "ephemera, a one-day-event". In reference to the leaks, he says "Such things do not impact real changes of mankind, of human existence, they don't promote real change. The landscape is changed by inspirational things. For example, we invented a project called 'how to organize our country'. This was an idea of [Solzhenitsyn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn). If we launch it right, this project will inspire people to change their surroundings. But the WikiLeaks materials do not inspire people to change the world that they are living in." This quote got me thinking, and ultimately writing this post. It struck me as very true. With all these leaks today it is easy to start creating these separations between statist and non-statist reporting and attitudes. We start to instantly draw conclusions that this information is damaging the states and possibly the global balance. Rather, I think, we should think how we can address these revelations because they are not lies.

Really the key criticism I am making of this documentary, among with other reporting, is the perception created that people who refuse the documents are somehow submitting to the state. I don't find this to be true, specifically for the reasons the Kazakh journalist stated above. A comment by [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange) towards the end of the film about the profitability of publishing cables reveals this short-sight. It is clear that Wikileaks is not afraid of damaging the state. However, damage without solutions does little to create optimistic views and progress. However where do the solutions come from? Journalists are not military experts, historians, or policy makers. They, in theory, should reveal the truth about current events and allow people, with or without power, to react.

It seems that leaks are damaging things faster than we can fix things. This is what I believe scares people. Regardless, solutions are needed and I am sure smart people will find them. Indeed it seems the [Fifth Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Estate) is really here, and will not be broken. This film shows they are not crazy, nor malicious. Rather they seek to display the truth. It is the solutions that seem really crazy. Even more so the difference between the amount of problems presented and possible solutions to address them is attributed, as malice, to the reporters. It seems we are shooting the messengers.
