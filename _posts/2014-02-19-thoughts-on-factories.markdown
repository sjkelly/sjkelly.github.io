title:  "Thoughts on factories"
---

The dawn of the industrial revolution brought around the concept of a factory, defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary as "the seat of some kind of production". The latter definition seems most relevant to the philosophy that will be conveyed. A factory is a centralized location where production happens, invariant of size. We also know that production involves the use of tools. Then we might reduce a factory to a coordinated environment where tools are used in production. However tools require techniques and resources. Equally production is for economic purpose. Expanding our definition we might think of the factory as a place where tools, techniques, and resources are used to produce goods of economic utility.

Recently the nature of the factory has been changing. If the industrial revolution introduced the notion of a factory, its changing facade either signals a new revolution or the start of a new era. However factories at different economic magnitudes seem poorly positioned to cope with the changing face of production. At one end there are centralized processes that are rapidly becoming decentralized. At the other end there smaller industries in the processes of industrialization and coordination, capitalizing on niche markets and more efficient local production. 

There are two main points in our philosophy. The first being coordinated processes, and the other being decentralized processes. The first has proven to be historically a management problem, where the coordination of resources and processes needs to be analyzed under a efficiency criteria. With the rise of Open Source Hardware and Crowd Funding, production in the more niche economic markets have generally been lacking in proper factory management. There are economic barriers to managed production, particularly  in the transaction costs. It is too difficult to establish an environment where analysis of resources and processes can take place.

The second problem arises from the economic integration of factories, in particular through their life cycle. The methods, resources, scale, and marketability of a factory and the corresponding production change over time. Economic progression in parallel with technological advancement call for periodic destruction of enterprise and paradigm. A system residing in a factory environment must be prepared to deal with such change. Destruction and creation of factories happens as the criteria for centralization and decentralization emerge. As systems become more centralized, they grow larger as they become decentralized they become smaller. We must then seek some similitude in behavior among varying scales of factories.
