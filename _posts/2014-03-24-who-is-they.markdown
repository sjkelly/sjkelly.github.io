title:  "Who is They"
---

Early this morning a few things came together in my head. Late last week I had read [Politics and the English Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Politics_and_the_English_Language&oldid=598767513) by George Orwell. In this essay Orwell presents how language is sometimes a poor media for conveying political truth. It is not a terribly long read and it is a widely applicable notion.

This blog post is not about Orwell, it is about finding out who is "they". I will admit, "they" is one of my biggest pet peeves. Now you are probably pretty confused, sorry. I really dislike when people prefix an accomplishment of the human race with "they". We are a single species and live on a single planet, this year at least. When some engineers at Stratasys figure out how to [print a car](http://korecologic.com/), I hear something along the lines of "Have you heard they can 3D print cars now!?". I ask, who the hell is "they"!?

I'm not here to complain about this without adequate understanding. I realized this morning _why_ this is a bad thing. I could probably just reference the [Sapir-Whorf hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) on linguistic relativity and be done with this blog post. That would be cheating. I need to try and convince you to stop saying "they did X awesome science thing", because even [Lojban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban) doesn't solve this problem. 

When we say "they", we mentally remove ourselves. "We" = "I" + "They".
 Which is to say "They" = "We" - "I".

Through taxes or the economic chain, we are all helping to make science and engineering possible. When we say "they" we start to remove the possibility of participation. I'd like to think that everyone _could_ do science and engineering if they wanted to. I believe that our language and dogmatic notions of science being difficult prevent us from trying to participate. 

People could say "they" because they forgot who did the work. I think that is admissible, but should be stated. "People at some lab have figured out how to [record photons](http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/trillionfps/), OMGWTFBBQ!"

"People", yes, I am one of people.
"Some lab", no, I am not part of some lab.

I think that if we grammatically involve ourselves in the development of cool science and engineering, our thoughts will allow us to me more connected to the development. I have studied very little psychology, so this might be covered already. 

When Orwell talks about the misuse of language for propaganda, or Bret Victor talks about [programming bounding our thoughts](http://vimeo.com/67076984), it is akin to the construction of a false notion of an individual through language. Maybe we could do a style of English removing "they", kind of like [E-Prime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime). My conjecture is that a careful use of language can redirect the admiration of intelligence and aspiration from a few scientists to _all of humanity_.
